### Machine learning

Machine Learning is a set of algorithms that read data, learn from it, and then apply what they’ve learned to make intelligent decisions.

Most machine learning methods often categorized as supervised learning or unsupervised learning, but now there is two more categories know as Semi-supervised and reinforcement learning.

*   Supervised machine learning algorithms work with labeled data and can be used to predict future events based on that data. During training, the machine learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the target value. After training, the system is capable enough to provide targets for any new input.

*   Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is not labeled. It infers a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The algorithm doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.
